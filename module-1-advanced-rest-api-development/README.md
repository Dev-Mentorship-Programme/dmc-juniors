# Module 1: Advanced REST API Development & Headless CMS

**Duration:** Week 1-4  
**Objective:** Master API design principles and build production-ready RESTful services

## Module Overview

This module covers advanced REST API development, including API architecture, design principles, CRUD operations, and modern HTTP features. Students will learn to build scalable, secure, and well-documented APIs.

## Weekly Breakdown

### Week 1: API Fundamentals and Architecture

- API-first development approach
- Understanding client-server architecture
- Introduction to headless CMS concepts
- API documentation and OpenAPI specification
- API versioning strategies
- Rate limiting and throttling
- API security fundamentals

### Week 2: REST vs GraphQL Deep Dive
- REST architectural principles and constraints
- RESTful resource design patterns
- HTTP methods and their proper usage (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Idempotency and safety in HTTP methods
- GraphQL fundamentals and query language
- When to use REST vs GraphQL
- Comparative analysis and trade-offs
- Implementing both REST and GraphQL endpoints

### Week 3: CRUD Operations and Advanced HTTP
- CRUD operations mapping to HTTP methods
- HTTP status codes and semantic meaning
- Custom status codes and error handling strategies
- Request/response headers and metadata
- Content negotiation and media types
- Caching strategies (ETags, Cache-Control)
- CORS and preflight requests
- HTTP/2 and modern protocol features

### Week 4: API Design and Data Handling
- Designing intuitive and consistent API routes
- Resource naming conventions and URI design
- Nested resources and relationship handling
- Request and response structure best practices
- Data validation and sanitization
- JSON schema validation
