Objective: 
To implement and compare a simple REST API and a GraphQL API.

Task 1: Build a RESTful API

Create a simple API for managing books. Implement the following endpoints:

GET /books: Get all books.
GET /books/:id: Get a single book.
POST /books: Create a new book.
PUT /books/:id: Update an existing book's details.
DELETE /books/:id: Delete a book.

Each book should have at least id, title, and author. Use a simple in-memory array to store the books (optional).


Task 2: Build a GraphQL API

Create a GraphQL API on a single endpoint (e.g., /graphql). Define a Book type in your schema with id, title, and author fields.

Implement a query to fetch a single book or all books.
Implement a mutation to create a new book.


Bonus Task (Comparative Analysis):

Using a tool like Postman or Insomnia, test both APIs.

Write a brief report (a few paragraphs) on the experience. Discuss which API was easier to set up, which felt more intuitive to use, and how you would design a task that favors one approach over the other.
